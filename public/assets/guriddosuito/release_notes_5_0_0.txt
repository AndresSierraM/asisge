Native Boostrap Support
--------------------------------------
As of version 5.0 Guriddo jqGrid can be adapted easy with any CSS framework. We have develoed a Bootstrap port. To use the feature you will need only to include the appropriate CSS

...
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="screen" href="path_to_css_files/ui.jqgrid-bootstrap.css" />
...

file and tell jqGrid to use Bootstrap ? with the option:


$("#grid").jqGrid( {
...
styleUI : "Bootstrap",
...
});

Except Column Chooser and re sizing the grid with a mouse we support all the jqGrid existing features.

You can enjoy the Guriddo jqGrid Bootstrap Demo

Independent CSS Styling
--------------------------------------
We have changed our code so that jqGrid can be developed with any CSS framework. This can be achieved with a setting of the styleUI object to use the appropriate classes. The full description will be added into the documentation.

Responsive Grid
-------------------------
We have added a responsive options which make the grid a really responsive.
With this options the grid is re sized automatically when the device is rotated and the windows width is changed. Another useful feature is auto calculating the the space of the navGrid buttons ? if the space does not fith the grid width we create a drop dawn menu button where all actions are inserted.

TreeGrid
-------------
We added new events and a method called reloadNode. With this method is possible to reload only certain node data and put it into the treeGrid instead of reloading the entrie treeGrid which in some situations consume a lot of time.

The code below reloaded only the added or edited node (Form editing module)

...
var reloadnode = function (rowid, rowdata, rowobject)
{
var id = $("#tree").jqGrid('getGridParam','selrow');
if(id) { // if add a root do not reload
var record = $("#tree").jqGrid('getLocalRow',id);
$("#tree").jqGrid('reloadNode', record);
}
}

$("#grid").jqGrid("navGrid",
{...},
{ "afterComplete" : reloadnode, "reloadAfterSubmit" : false, "closeAfterSubmit" :true}, //add
{ "afterComplete" : reloadnode, "reloadAfterSubmit" : false, "closeAfterSubmit" :true}, //edit
...
);

PivotGrid
--------------
Fixed a lot of Bugs related to showing the labels and groupig.
